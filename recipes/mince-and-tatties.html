    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is simple, but delicious, old fashioned Scottish food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>454g beef mince</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>1 beef stock cube</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>400ml of beef gravy made with Bisto powder</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>3 large potatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a large saucepan over a medium high heat and brown the mince, breaking it up with a fork to separate it. Crumble in the Oxo cube, add the onions and continue to cook on a high heat until the mince has browned and no traces of pink remain.</li>
        <li>Add the diced carrots, the gravy or beef stock and the Worcestershire sauce, if using. Turn the heat to low-medium, pop on a lid and cook for at least an hour or until the mince is nice and soft and the gravy has thickened. Season to taste. That's all there is to it!</li>
        <li>Cook your tatties, mash them with lots of butter (some people add milk but I don't usually bother) and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>
